# Simple-Senderer
This project allows to simply clean your phone out of old photos. Imagine that you have only a few free MB of space and one of your most important application has just got a big update. What would you do? Simply use my application to send your old photos safely to any desktop in the same network. Other use case is to sent just taken photo from your device directly to desktop without wasting your smartphone memory. If you want to know more about my application visit official website simple.senderer.com.
